# coinbase-cli

This is a command-line utility that uses the Coinbase API to trade, deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies.

On busy days, it has happened that the Coinbase website was down while its underlying API services still worked. This command-line tool
is my emergency backup, so that I can trade when everyone else is. Of course, there are many other use cases for a command-line tool such as
easily automating trading tasks or inspecting the prices.

## Work In Progress

This is work in progress. Don't worry, you won't have to wait long. I'm working hard on it at the moment.

Intended features:
* Buy, Sell, Deposit, and Withdraw through command-line commands
* Interactive mode

The reason you see this unusable version on NPM is that I published an alpha version to see that the published project structure works.
